Added a Megacorp Civic: Construction Company. This increases how much Industrial Production you get from trade value for each empire you have met.*

Added some Default Realdev settings for planets based on a collection of Development Milestones.*

Added a collection of Realdev Default Settings that can be set in the Country UI, and can optionally be used by planets instead of setting them in the Planet UI.*

Implemented a "Simple Mode" setting that changes various facets of Realistic Development to be easier to manage.*

Did something to Void Dwellers*

Capped Industrial Production on any 1 object to +/- 2 million, to avoid overflow.*

Fixed Orbital District not providing the correct bonus production to Factory Modules on some planet types.*

Overhauled Factory Modules to use a Variable Multipler system for determining production.*

Orbital Districts now affect the Variable Multiplier system instead of applying output modifiers for Autofab.*

Habitats now use the Planet Size of the planet they are orbiting for calculating Orbital Infrastructure Cap.*

Added a Target mode for Industrial Production on planets, wherein they try to get a certain amount, either taking what they need from the country, or sending excess to the country.*

Fixed the Orbital Platforms from the district having seizures.*

Fixed Gigas Ruined Ships blocking Minor Colonies.*

Added a second colour to the Country Assistance slider in the realdev planet UI to show how much of the country stockpile is being used.*

Changed Assembly to have a per cap based on how many Roboticist (Or equivalent) jobs exist.*

If Assembly is given more IP than it can use with the cap, extra is sent to the country.*

Changed it so when a planet is not building anything, Industrial Production will be sent to Assembly.*

Changed it so when a planet can't assemble any pops, it won't send IP to assembly, regardless of the ratio. Note this is not "Not assembling pops" but rather "Can't assemble pops".*

Added a thing in the realdev planet UI to let you use IP to increase job production instead of boosting assembly.*

Temporarily changed Orbital Shipyards to give Ship IP if Realdev is active, a country modifier to ship build speed if not.*

Added bling to the ROCI game start settings menu.*

Fixed realdev giving IP to minor colonies when exploit is disabled.*

Added a [?] button to each UI, that contains a tooltip providing some explanation of how that window works.*

Added a tooltip to each module button in the game start settings menu, that says how to interact with the module.*

Merged the Exploit and Autofab Minimum Stockpile menus. They now use the same one.*

Added a tooltip to the Minimum Stockpile title explaining what it means, and when it applies.*

Added breakdowns of the sources of Industrial Production and Capacity in the Planet UI, as well as tooltips for these new buttons explaining how they work.*

Added a collection of buttons to the realdev planet UI that breaks down the sources of Industrial Production. These buttons have tooltips explaining the formula for each.*

Added a collection of buttons to the realdev planet UI that breaks down the sources of Industrial Production Capacity. These buttons have tooltips explaining the formula for each.*

Added support for Production Revolution's Manpower to Realdev. Manpower is now treated as pops for the purposes of IP generation.*

Added a "Space Colonizer" Origin that deals with Minor Colonies.*

Merged pulse events properly, to reduce performance impact.*

Added a Branch Office Building that gives Industrial Production to both the planet owner and Megacorp. And a variant for Criminal Corps.*

Added 2 upgrades to the Equipment Factory. Capital Planets now start with T2.*

Made unused IP in the Country Stockpile be distributed to country uses.*











Fixed Starting Minor Colonies having more construction than they should be able to support.*

Added a Progress fraction to the Factory Expanding planetary modifier, in an attempt to replace the countdown it previously had.*

Halved the bonus research from the Orbital Research District.*

Orbital Districts now also add a 0.1 alloy upkeep cost per job they affect. Those that don't affect jobs (Housing, Commercial) instead do 0.05 alloys per pop on the planet.*

Added a Preset Empire for the Autofab Origin.*

Added a Preset Empire for the Space Colonizer Origin.*
