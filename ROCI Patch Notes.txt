Added a collection of Realdev Default Settings that can be set in the Country UI, and can optionally be used by planets instead of setting them in the Planet UI.*

Implemented a "Simple Mode" setting that changes various facets of Realistic Development to be easier to manage.*

Added a Target mode for Industrial Production on planets, wherein they try to get a certain amount, either taking what they need from the country, or sending excess to the country.*

Added Development Milestones. These can affect both the Target system and Ratios. These are a collection of triggers that modify the Target and Ratios based on the status of the planet or country they apply to.*

Added bling to the ROCI game start settings menu.*

Added a "Space Colonizer" Origin that deals with Minor Colonies.*

Changed Assembly to have a per cap based on how many Roboticist (Or equivalent) jobs exist. Assembly Speed is now also "split" between them, like it is with shipyards. This will cause empires with lots of assembly jobs (Like machines) to require more IP to get the max boost.*

Added a tooltip to the Minimum Stockpile title explaining what it means, and when it applies.*



Improved tooltip readability about what is actually failing on Autofab UI buttons.*

Improved tooltip readability about what is actually failing on Exploit UI buttons.*



Fixed being able to go negative on how many Autofab Modules you have.*

Fix autofab extractors remaining queued on planets that don't have any sr deposits.*

Fixed the Autofab document script so it stops reporting negative amounts, and also so it stops giving increasingly large numbers whenever you refresh it.*

Made autofab retooling respect Realdev.*

Simplified autofab loop events. This should reduce the performance impact of lots of colonies building at once.*

Added an effect that can be called to log orbital values on things.*

Added an effect that can be called to log exploit values on things.*

Added an effect that can be called to log realdev values on things.*

Added an effect that can be called to log trade values on things.*

Moved the Trade Value provided by completed exploit constructions to the minor colonies.*

Optimized detection events for when Cargo Ships have Sudden Dissapearance Syndrome, or other circumstances in which a trade route is cancelled.*

Fixed minor colonies on game start not having mining stations on them for some reason.*

Changed trade routes to never expire. Instead, they are cancelled if you have the trade fleet do something else.*

Scripted more complex AI triggers involving all orbital platforms, so maybe they'll stop spamming Refinery and Shipyard platforms.*

Gave the Realdev Empire UI the same treatment as the Planet UI, having a host of buttons that display numbers and tooltips about those numbers.*

Made unused IP in the Country Stockpile be distributed to country uses.*

Merged the Exploit and Autofab Minimum Stockpile menus. They now use the same one.*




-Trade Routes now also apply a +1 1/year decaying opinion modifier per cargo ship in the fleet. Empires with closer planets that get cargo ship visits more often will like you more(And vice-versa).* Looks to be impossible to implement how I want

Scripted more complex AI triggers for the Orbital Defense Platforms, so they are hopefully a bit more smart about it.* Not sure how to actually go about this. Will need some ideas.

Added a second colour to the Country Assistance slider in the realdev planet UI to show how much of the country stockpile is being used.* This hard

Fixed Gigas Ruined Ships blocking Minor Colonies.* This might not even be a problem.

Overhauled Exploit to have production work through a deposit on the Hosting Major Colonies instead.* This hard. And honestly not *that* neccesary

Merged some pulse events properly, to reduce performance impact.* Uh... save it for if this becomes a problem?

Reduced performance impact of Orbital stuff.* Uh... save it for if this becomes a problem?

Added support for Production Revolution's Manpower to Realdev. Manpower is now treated as pops for the purposes of IP generation.* Need to know the Manpower Variable

Capped Industrial Production on any 1 object to +/- 2 million, to avoid overflow.* Not sure if even necessary outside of edge cases where the system is broken anyway

Fixed Starting Minor Colonies having more construction than they should be able to support.* This is a PITA to try doing

Added a Progress fraction to the Factory Expanding planetary modifier effect, in an attempt to replace the countdown it previously had.* The countdown doesn't seem to be missed

Orbital Districts now also add a 0.1 alloy upkeep cost per job they affect. Those that don't affect jobs (Housing, Commercial) instead do 0.05 alloys per pop on the planet.* Might not do, see if current district upkeep is good enough

Added a Preset Empire for the Autofab Origin.* Maybe later, maybe never

Added a Preset Empire for the Space Colonizer Origin.* Maybe later, maybe never

Added a Branch Office Building that gives Industrial Production to both the planet owner and Megacorp. And a variant for Criminal Corps.* Need a way to have it affect the corp empire


#These are harder than they first appeared, and have issues that I'm not sure how to deal with.
Overhauled Factory Modules to use a Variable Multipler system for determining production.*

Orbital Districts now affect the Variable Multiplier system instead of applying output modifiers for Autofab.*

Fallen Empire Buildings now affect the Variable Multiplier system instead of being built-in production bonuses on the modules.*

Fixed Orbital District not providing the correct bonus production to Factory Modules on some planet types.*
