_________________________

Added descriptions to the decisions.

_________________________

Added images for Strategic Resource Factory deposits.

Fixed errors relating to events that are not supposed to show up.

Decisions now don't show up as unlocked by techs if you don't have the origin.

Replaced the existing Edicts and Decisions with Custom UI, making the factory far easier to control.

Added Queue functionality, so you can queue up several constructions.

Added Fallback functionality, so you can choose whether the Automation and Queue will only buid on the correct planets, or simply prefer them.

Rolled the Document Factory Edict into the new custom UI for controlling the Factory.

Changed the Advisor over to a custom UI, allowing far simpler navigation of topics. The content of the advisor has also been overhauled, due to how you manage the factory being overhauled.

All factory functions can now be controlled from the single Country UI, accessed by the Factory Terminal edict. It can also be accessed from planet specific Factory Terminals.

The factory terminals show how many factory deposits are in the empire/on the planet, and include how many are queued to build, and how many are currently being built.

Added a check for vanilla swapping, so it doesn't convert buildings if there are no district slots left.

Converted separate deposits for Habitats into triggered modifiers on the normal deposits.

Factory module costs now follow the district costs of the planet they are being built on. No longer will Ecu factories cost just as much as a factory on a normal planet.

Retooling has been redone so it works with the new queue system.

Added more triggered modifiers to cancel out OP technician modifiers that are inherited.

Added a button to open the Country Factory Terminal in the bottom left of the screen.

Included triggers to prepare for allowing anyone to use the factory, leaving the origin to have a head start on it.

The Planet UI includes an option to block the primary Autofab being built by Automation or the Queue on that planet.

The Country UI has an option to block the primary Autofab from being built by Automation or the Queue.

The vanilla Processing Buildings (Energy Grid, Mineral Purification, Food Processing) grant extra production to Factory Modules, as they would to normal districts.

Changed Factory and Forge Modules to normal district cost, instead of building cost.

The Factory is now afffected by the vanilla Subsidy Edicts.

We have a new Workshop Image, and new Origin Icon, and a New Origin Image.

Replaced raw effect dump on menu buttons with a layman's tooltip.

Fixed Vanilla Swapping to work with 3.0 stuff. It also costs alloys now, as building them directly would.

Added a button to both planet and Country UIs to immediately trigger Vanilla Swapping on all existing stuff.

Disabled Automation until I can properly implement it in 3.0.

Included support for Dynamic Mod Menu. It is now a required item.

_________________________

Buffed how much bonus production the AP gives for Origin users, up to 40%. (This is additive with other modifiers, so it might not be as good as you think.)

Changed the AP to require another AP being selected already.

Fixed the DMM implementation to properly open the terminal.

Fixed text in the advisor saying you use a decision to build the Factory.

Added Factory Costs and times to the advisor, under Factory Queue.

Fixed Vanilla Swapping button messing stuff up.

Added tooltips to Vanilla Swap button.

Fixed the Autofab Construction option in the planet terminal blocking buttons when it is on.

Fixed Planet queue not being able to build the Factory.

Fixed counting of districts, so that ones being built count against available districts.

_________________________

Fixed a minor error in Vanilla Swapping script.

Actually fixed planets being unable to build the Factory themselves.

Cleaned up the error log some.

_________________________

Upped the minimum size for your home planet to 25, since vanilla upped normal planet sizes.

Fixed loc for the AP to properly say what it actually gives.

Fixed district space counting breaking stuff because Stellaris has a fit.

Fixed a typo in my variable name.

Made Betharian power bonus require the betharian tech.

Fixed button triggers so you can Minus from the Queue value.

Increased the construction time of the Factory, and the Factory Modules, to 3 years and 480 days, respectively.

Added a button to each UI to refresh it.

Gave machine empires their proper bonus base production.

Updated production to account for vanilla buildings giving bonus production rather than extra jobs.

Updated production values for ringworlds, as their districts have been changed.

Fixed Foundry Modules not increasing production on Ringworlds.

Hives get their bonus production from having more jobs now, at the cost of housing.

Included support for the Machine civic for more minerals from miners.

_________________________

_________________________

Fixed motes checking for food availability.

_________________________

Fixed the Origin not affecting Bio Pop Assembly.

_________________________

Fixed the Ringworld Energy Module taking Exotic Gases instead of Rare Crystals, because Paradox.

Rewrote the Automation section of the advisor to be in line with the new functionality.

Added checks to Queue functionality for Automation stuff.

Fixed vanilla swapping working on newly-built stuff even after you turn it off.

Fixed vanilla swapping working through the button to trigger it after your turn it off.

Fixed the Immediate Swap button being able to be clicked if vanilla swapping is off, and it would thus do nothing.

Made all Autofab Modules cost an Admin cap. Test to see if this helps balance.

Moved the Betharian bonus effect to the Extractor Module. It is also now +1 energy per Generator Module, and +25% energy from all Generator Modules, per betharian deposit, up to 3.

_________________________

Fixed the AP not doing stuff it needs to. This will not fix existing games, you can do that by typing into the console `effect autofab_game_start = yes` with nothing selected.

_________________________

Changed documenting the Factory to respect Fallback settings.

Changed Alloys, Congoods, Motes, Gases, and Crystals to be their own tracking variable, instead of just using Available Districts, so they can respect Fallback.

Changed Automation building logic for Autofab to use the new tracking variables on everything.

Automation now ignores resources if their Production Target is 0(Except Alloys, because you can't set a target for it).

Added a whole bunch of logging to my Automation scripts, so hopefully I might actually be able to diagnose what's actually happening sometimes.

_________________________

Added a check to automation so it doesn't queue multiple modules on the same planet in the same Automation Cycle.

You can now queue Autofab Modules after the Autofab is queued. They will start building after the Autofab is built.

Added a tooltip to the Gray planet buttons about how those settings default to the country settings.

Fixed some wonkiness with the Planet Terminal.

Having both the Origin and Civic gives -10% upkeep.

The bonus production from the AP is now ties to having both the Origin/civic and AP.

The civic works with all non-special planet origins.

The civic works with the Resource Consolidation origin.

The civic works with the Remnants origin.

The civic works with the Life-Seeded origin.

The civic works with the Void Dweller origin.

Buffed the civic to give +20% factory production overall.

Buffed the civic to only give a 30% production malus.
